# Decentralized Storage Platform - Live Demo

Welcome to the live demo of our Decentralized Storage Platform!

## About This Demo

This is a frontend-only demonstration of our decentralized storage platform. The demo is running in "Demo Mode," which means it simulates the functionality of the full application without requiring an actual blockchain or IPFS backend.

## Demo Features

- **File Upload**: You can upload files (simulated, files won't actually be stored)
- **File Management**: View, download, and share your simulated files
- **Provider Dashboard**: Explore the storage provider interface
- **User Dashboard**: See storage statistics and file listings

## Important Notes

1. **This is a DEMO**: No actual files are being stored on IPFS or blockchain
2. **No Real Blockchain Transactions**: No actual cryptocurrency is being used
3. **Data Persistence**: Your actions are not persisted between sessions
4. **Mock Data**: All displayed data is simulated for demonstration purposes

## How to Use

1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" (this will use a demo wallet)
2. **Upload Files**: Navigate to the upload page and select files
3. **View Files**: See your uploaded files in the dashboard
4. **Provider Mode**: Explore the provider interface to see how storage providers interact with the platform

## Full Deployment

For a full deployment with actual blockchain and IPFS integration, please refer to our [deployment guide](DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Material UI
- **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum (simulated in demo)
- **Storage**: IPFS (simulated in demo)
- **Authentication**: Web3 wallet integration (simulated in demo)
